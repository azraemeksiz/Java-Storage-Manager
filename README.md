# Java-Storage-Manager
I designed this project in Intellij IDEA. The source code is uploaded but I did not upload the .idea files. If you want to use this code you need to create a project in IDEA and import the source code to run it properly. This project reads out the CSV file and sorts the items by price for products and by safety level for equipments. It asks you about the quantites and in return you will get the average price of the requested quantity of the cheapest products and the quantity of equipment with a safety level greater than or equal to the specified value. You can edit the CSV file according to your liking.
